Model Download Instructions for Face Embedding Visualization Project
==================================================================

The FaceNet model files are required but not included in this repository due to size limitations.

📁 DOWNLOAD REQUIRED MODEL FILES:
Google Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17-MR7fSc342OcIneN0bV6mKX_j02jska?usp=sharing

📋 SETUP STEPS:
1. Visit the Google Drive link above
2. Download all files in the folder
3. Create a 'models' folder in your project directory (if it doesn't exist)
4. Create a '20180402-114759' subfolder inside 'models'
5. Place the downloaded files in: models/20180402-114759/

📁 Required file structure after download:
models/
└── 20180402-114759/
    ├── 20180402-114759.pb                              (Main model file)
    ├── model-20180402-114759.ckpt-275.data-00000-of-00001
    ├── model-20180402-114759.ckpt-275.index
    └── model-20180402-114759.meta

⚠️  IMPORTANT: 
- The main model file '20180402-114759.pb' is essential for the project to work
- Without these files, the face embedding generation will fail
- File sizes are large (~100MB+) so ensure you have sufficient space

✅ Once downloaded and placed correctly, you can run:
   python trial_script.py

🔗 Model Source: 
These are pre-trained FaceNet models from the original research.
